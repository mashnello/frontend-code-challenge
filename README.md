# Front-End Interview Test

## Technologies
React, Less.
It was not necessary to use Redux (etc.) to manage the state for such app.
I've chosen React because it is my current lovely library, and I pretty much effecient with it. Less I've used just in case. For the current app state it's not really needed, but I don't want to rewrite styles from raw CSS later.

## Excuses
I'm going through all of the Bonus Points, for sure. Some of them are interesting for me and I want to learn more about them.
But, unfortunately, I don't have enough time. But I will try.

Btw if the order of my commits looks strange (e.g. eslint setup after the whole app is ready), that's becase of time limits as well. I gave an estimate, that the app will be ready till Monday morning, and it is. Agree you wouldn't care how many development tools are configured if the application is not ready.
