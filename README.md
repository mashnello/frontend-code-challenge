# Front-End Interview Test

## Technologies
React, Less.
It was not necessary to use Redux (etc.) to manage the state for such app.
I've chosen React because it is my current lovely library, and I pretty much effecient with it. Less I've used just in case. For the current app state it's not really needed, but I don't want to rewrite styles from raw CSS later.
